/// <param name="TabTitle">The exact label VSCode shows on the session's tab: the last

/// Primary display title and the session↔tab correlation key.</param>
/// <param name="AutoTitle">Heuristic session title: last summary entry, else the first
/// real user prompt. Secondary display title.</param>
/// <param name="Pending">Set when the transcript's last assistant turn issued a tool call
/// that has no tool_result yet. Hook-independent: the VSCode extension doesn't fire
/// Notification/PostToolUse at all, so this is the only trustworthy "waiting" signal
/// there (issue 2026-07-20).</param>
/// <param name="LabelCandidates">Every string VSCode might be showing as this session's
/// tab label, newest first. The tab label is the ONLY handle the extension gives us on a
/// tab (there is no session id in the VSCode tab API), so correlation is string matching —
/// and matching a single title is too brittle: a session whose transcript has no
/// "ai-title" at all gets labelled from a user prompt instead, which no single title field
/// reproduces (issue 2026-07-20, second report). Matching against the whole candidate set
/// covers every labelling rule Claude Code uses without having to know which one applied.</param>
/// <param name="Lost">Set when the transcript's tail carries a task-notification reporting
/// background agents with no completion record — the session's previous process died with
/// them still running. No hook carries this: measured 2026-08-14, SessionStart fires seconds
/// BEFORE the notification is written and carries nothing about it, UserPromptSubmit reports
/// the user's own prompt rather than the notification, and by then Stop's background_tasks is
/// empty. The transcript is the only witness.</param>
/// <param name="ForegroundAgents">Agent calls this session has out that are still running —
/// the ones dispatched WITHOUT run_in_background, which no hook can report. A background
/// Agent call answers in milliseconds with async_launched, so it is never pending here; a
/// foreground one holds its tool_use open for as long as the agent works, and that is exactly
/// the signal. The subagent's own turns are sidechain lines and are skipped, so its internal
/// tool calls never inflate the count.</param>
/// <param name="MonitorTaskIds">The background-task ids this session armed with the Monitor
/// tool. NOT a liveness signal on its own — a Monitor answers immediately, so its tool_use is
/// never pending and the transcript never says when the watch ended. It is the missing HALF of
/// one: the Stop hook's <c>background_tasks</c> says which tasks are still running but reports
/// a Monitor and a backgrounded shell identically (measured 11-09-2026: both type=shell,
/// status=running), and this says which of those ids was a Monitor. Intersect the two and you
/// have the watches that are actually live, which is the only form of the question the deck can
/// answer honestly.</param>
/// <param name="JobTaskIds">The background-task ids this session launched as backgrounded Bash
/// JOBS — the same missing half as <paramref name="MonitorTaskIds"/>, for the other kind of
/// machine work that ends a turn. A job differs from a Monitor in one way that matters to the
/// person reading the deck: it is computing and it will finish, where a monitor only listens and
/// what it listens for may never arrive. Both mean the same thing about the card, which is that
/// the session is waiting on a machine and not on the user.
///
/// What is deliberately NOT here is the reason a background shell counted for nothing until now:
/// a dev server left up by a session that then genuinely finished with a question would silence
/// that question forever. So the command text decides — it is in the transcript, keyed by task
/// id, which the hook payload is not — and a command matching <see cref="ServerCommand"/> is
/// read as a process nobody is waiting for and counts for nothing, exactly as before. Everything
/// else backgrounded terminates, and a terminating background task notifies its session, which is
/// the definition of work that will claim its own turn back.</param>
/// <param name="EndsOnExit">The last line is a <c>cost-state</c> entry — the CLI writes one
/// when its process exits and at no other time, so a transcript that ENDS on one belongs to a
/// session with no process behind it. Unlike every tab-label signal this proves something on
/// its own, and it survives the one thing a SessionEnd hook does not: the deck being down when
/// the process went. Measured 28-09-2026 over the 40 newest transcripts on this machine: every
/// live session ended on something else, every dead one on this, and a resume always appends
/// <c>bridge-session</c> lines at start, which takes the file off it again.</param>
/// <param name="Entrypoint">Where this session runs: "claude-vscode" for the VSCode
/// extension, "cli"/"sdk-cli" for a terminal. Every message line carries it. Only a
/// VSCode-hosted session may be closed when its VSCode window exits — a terminal session
/// in the same folder outlives the window (decision 13 keeps the engine generic).</param>
/// <param name="LastMessageAtUtc">Timestamp of the newest line that has one — i.e. the
/// last real conversation event. NOT the file's mtime: Claude Code appends a timestampless
/// "last-prompt" record when a tab opens or closes, which bumps the mtime with no
/// conversation behind it and read as a sign of life to the orphan sweep (issue
/// 2026-08-09 — a session dead for three days kept its card).</param>
