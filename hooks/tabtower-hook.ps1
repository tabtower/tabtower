# Is this session a `claude -p` run rather than one a human opened? CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT is
# INHERITED by everything a session spawns, so a batch of `claude -p` runs launched from inside a
# session reports claude-vscode and reads as interactive - measured 18-08-2026, four dispatched
# runs sat on a card as sessions the user could click, resume and be blinked at, none of which
# the user started. The command line is the only ground truth ("claude  -p --dangerously-skip-permissions"
# against the IDE's "...native-binary\claude.exe --output-format stream-json ..."), but reading it
# costs ~1.2s through CIM, which is three times the whole bridge's budget for one event.
#
# So the cheap half runs first: the exe PATH (10ms) of a session opened in the IDE is always the
# extension's own binary. Only when that contradicts the environment - the entrypoint claims the
# IDE while the binary is a standalone CLI - is the expensive half paid, and only that one session
# pays it. A session the user really opened never reaches the CIM call, and nothing is ever hidden

# file. Nothing else in the payload can see it: the session id is identical by definition, and
# the transcript is the shared victim rather than the witness. CLAUDE_PID is the CLI's own pid
# and it is CONSTANT across every event of a session, subagent events included (measured the
# same night on a probe session: one pid over SessionStart, PreToolUse, SubagentStart,
# SubagentStop and Stop, with a background agent out), so a second pid is never a subagent and
