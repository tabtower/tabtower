// SessionDeck Connector (SPEC stage D).
//
// Outbound: keeps a persistent connection to SessionDeck's named pipe and pushes a
// "vscode-sync" snapshot (workspace folder, git branch, open Claude Code tabs) on
// activation and on every tab/branch change.
//
// Inbound: SessionDeck pushes commands down the same connection. "openSession"
// delegates to Claude Code's own claude-vscode.editor.open, which reveals the tab
// if the session is open and resumes it if not — the extension holds the
// session_id↔tab map, so no correlation is needed on our side. "closeSession" (v0.6.12,
// reshaped in v0.6.13) closes a DEAD session's tab by label, and only when exactly one Claude
// tab carries one of the session's labels. It deliberately does NOT reveal the session to find
// its tab: revealing a dead session makes Claude Code start a fresh CLI on the old transcript,
// and the revived session carries on from wherever its context says it was (seen 05-09-2026:
// one worked twenty minutes beside its own successor). An ambiguous label is left alone.
// "closeSession" with ById (v0.6.16) is the opposite trade for a session that is ALIVE here:
// it reveals by session id and closes what the reveal put in front — see closeClaudeTabById.
// "newSession" with AfterSessionId / NoFocus (v0.6.14) opens the tab next to a live session's
// tab and hands the window's previously active tab back — see openNewSessionQuietly.
